# The Impact of Remote Work Analysis Project

## Executive Summary
Remote work has become a fundamental aspect of modern employment, driven by technological advancements and global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While remote work offers flexibility and potential productivity gains, it also presents challenges related to employee well-being, collaboration, and organizational effectiveness. This study examines the long-term implications of remote work on productivity and mental health, using key datasets to inform best practices and policy recommendations. By analyzing global trends and key determinants of successful remote work models, this research aims to provide data-driven insights for organizations adapting to hybrid and remote work environments.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Employee Productivity Index (EPI)**
   - Measures changes in individual and team productivity before and after transitioning to remote work.
   - Target: 10% increase in task completion rates over a year.
   - Baseline: Pre-pandemic in office productivity levels.
  
2. **Work-Life Balance Score (WLBS)**
   - Evaluates employee satisfaction regarding their ability to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
   - Target: 80% of employees report a positive work-life balance.
   - Baseline: Current industry average of 65%.
  
3. **Employee Engagement Level (EEL)**
   - Measures motivation, job satisfaction, and overall engagement using survey data and company records.
   - Target: Maintain an engagement score of at least 70.
   - Baseline: Current company-wide average.
  
4. **Stress and Burnout Rate (SBR)**
   - Tracks the percentage of employees experiencing stress, burnout, or mental health challenges due to remote work.
   - Target: Reduce burnout rates to below 15%.
   - Baseline: Industry average of 25% burnout rate.
  
5. **Retention and Turnover Rates (RTR)**
   - Compares employee retention in remote, hybrid, and in-office work environments.
   - Target: Reduce voluntary turnover by 10% annually.
   - Baseline: Current company turnover rate.

DATA FOR TERM PROJECT MILESTONE 2:

Below are the visualizations for each of my 5 Key Performance Indicators, along with an interpretation of each visualization.

KPI #1: Employee Productivity


In these visualizations, it shows a survey of 20 teams and their average employee productivity level on a scale of 0-100 in a pre remote work (office) environment and a post remote work (at home) environment. The orange bar displaying pre remote and blue displaying post remote work. Out of the data collected, results show that the average productivity level out of the 20 teams is higher in an in office environment rather than at home. The second visualization for this specific KPI is to display the total average without including the teams. The results showed that the participants of the survey gave an in office productivity score of 80.42 compared to a score of 77.41 for an at home environment. This means that employees are experiencing some possible distractions or less of a work drive when working remotely.

KPI #2: Work-Life Balance (WLB)


In this visualization, I am comparing the average pre and post remote work work-life balance scores along with work satisfaction scores. The scores are based on a 0-100 scale and are divided into the different departments within the surveyed company. The results display that out of the 5 departments, pre remote WLB scores were higher than post remote work scores. The one outlier is in the IT department, which can be explained by the type of work IT specialists do, as they can primarily complete most of their work remotely. In terms of the work satisfaction scores, the results show that every department experienced a decrease in work satisfaction, with most scores decreasing by a range of 5-10 points.

KPI #3: Employee Engagement Level (EEL)


In this visualization, I am comparing the average employee engagement levels and work satisfaction scores based on the different job roles within the surveyed company. The results for the EEL vary across the different job roles, with 4 of the 5 roles having a decrease in engagement. This was expected based on the other visualizations as it seems employees are experiencing distractions in the remote workplace. The one outlier is again in the IT/specialist roles, as mentioned before, they can complete most of their workload remotely. As expected, job satisfaction also decreased in the post remote workspaces. The one outlier is in management roles, as this specific surveyed company felt they manage their duties better while working remotely. 

KPI #4: Stress & Burnout Rate


In this visualization, I am comparing the average pre and post remote stress and burnout rates, along with comparing them to the average weekly hours worked, while sorting them by job role. The results are interesting to see the stress and burnout levels increased exponentially by scores of 12 to 16. What makes these interesting is that it shows that employees are working 2-3 less hours a week, which you would think would help with stress. But looking at the other results of project, I can understand that these values may vary depending on the distractions and home life that different employees have, and that less work hours may not mean less "busy" hours at home.  

KPI #5: Retention and Turnover Rates


In this visualization, I am evaluating the reasons why employees left their current jobs, and whether working in office, hybrid, or fully remote made a difference. This is all compared to the average tenured months with the company. The results are varied depending on the reason for the turnover so there is not a clear pattern. That being said, hybrid workers left primarily for better opportunties and management issues, in office workers for job insecurity and salary, and remote workers for job insecurity and management issues. On the right side of the graph, the retained employees are listed, with the highest retained group being hybrid workers, followed by in office, and then remote. Which could be used to interpret that remote employees, again, are not enjoying their remote work as much as in an office setting.
